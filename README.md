# 🌟 BigQueryGPT🌟

Born from curiosity and a desire to bridge two worlds: ChatGPT and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). 

Meet BigQueryGPT – a custom-built tool that extends ChatGPT's capabilities to interact seamlessly with GCP services on (personal) projects, starting with BigQuery.

## 🤔 Why BigQueryGPT?

The journey began with a simple question: How can ChatGPT talk to GCP services to assist me better? BigQueryGPT is the answer. It's a tool to make BigQuery queries more accessible, efficient, and user-friendly.

## 🔧 Tools used:

- **Docker**: For smooth deployment.
- **FastAPI (Python)**: For a fast, reliable, and easy-to-use API experience.
- **Cloudflare**: Ensuring security for protected routes
- **A GCP Service Account**: Facilitating authentic and secure interactions with GCP services.

## 🌐 What Does BigQueryGPT Do?

- **SQL Query Construction**: Helps construct SQL queries by analyzing BigQuery schemas.
- **Schema Insights**: Offers a deeper understanding of your BigQuery tables.
- **Dataset insights**: What tables does a dataset have? What can we do with them?

## 💡 Use Cases:

- **Efficient Query Building**: From simple metrics to complex queries, it's all made easy.
- **Learning and Exploration**: A great resource for those looking to deepen their SQL and BigQuery knowledge.

For me, BigQueryGPT represents the first step in exploring how ChatGPT can interact with GCP services, making BigQuery just the beginning of this exciting journey.
